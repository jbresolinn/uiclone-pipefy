## About

This is a clone of the <a href="https://pipefy.com">Pipefy</a> interface developed with ReactJS! In the project technologies such as styled-components and drag n' drop were used. 

Because, it is a simple project, focusing on the use of drag n' drop, some current pipefy features have not a been replicated, but if you want to contribute you can make a project fork and implement it as you wish.


## What is the UI Clone?

UI Clone is a project developed and applied by <a href="https://github.com/Rocketseat">@rocketseat</a> where the interface of several applications that are on the rise in recent years is recreated.
